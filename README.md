# Cryptographic Hardware Optimization for ASIC

## About

Cryptographic hardware are specialized computation structures dedicated to the 
execution of a single or a few cryptographic algorithms. Through specialization, 
hardware achieves higher performance, lower power consumption, and lower silicon 
cost compared to equivalent cryptographic software implementations. The difference 
in efficiency can be orders of magnitude. Yet, while the performance benefits of 
hardware are well understood, the cryptographic engineering community is generally 
unfamiliar with the process of mapping algorithms to hardware structures. 
For example, reference implementations of new cryptographic standards are more 
commonly found in software than in hardware. With the advent of open source hardware 
design tools, and especially open-source ASIC design tools, a great opportunity 
exists for a culture of hardware engineering in the cryptographic community. The 
potential gains of cryptographic implementations in efficiency, in scope, and in 
innovation are simply too big to ignore the hardware design domain.
